    <h1> Denzel's baking journey </h1>
    
    <h2> How he started his baking journey </h2>
    <p> Denzel discovered his love for baking at the tender age of 10 when he baked his first batch of chocolate chip cookies with his grandmother. The joy of creating something delicious from scratch enthralled him. Over the years, he honed his skills by experimenting with various recipes and even creating some of his own. His dream is to share the joy of baking with others and inspire them to create their own baked wonders.</p>
    
    <h2> Three of his favorite recipes </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <h3>Almond Croissants: A delicate pastry filled with the sweet nutty goodness of almond paste, dusted with powdered sugar, and baked to a golden perfection</h3>
      </li>
        <p> Ingredients: 1 sheet of puff pastry, 1/2 cup of almond paste, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1 egg (for egg wash).</p>
        <p> Instructions:
        First, preheat the oven to 375°F. Next, roll out the puff pastry and cut it into triangles. Spread a thin layer of almond paste on each triangle. Then, roll each triangle from the base to the tip and curve into a crescent shape. Finally, brush with egg wash and sprinkle with powdered sugar, and bake for 15-20 minutes until it’s golden brown.</p>

        <h3> Sourdough Bread: A community favorite, boasting a crusty exterior and a soft, airy interior, embodying the classic sourdough charm </h3>
      </li>
        <p> Ingredients: 1 cup sourdough starter, 1 1/2 cups warm water, 4 cups bread flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.</p>
        <p> Instructions:
        First, mix the starter, water, and 3 cups of flour in a large bowl. This should create a sticky dough. Next, add salt, and remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time until they are fully incorporated. Then, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 15 minutes. Once the kneading is done, place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for about 5 hours. Finally, shape the dough into a loaf, and let it rest for 30 minutes. When you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450°F and bake for about 30 minutes until it's golden brown.</p>
